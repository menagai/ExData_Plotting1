* Save the R scripts where the data file (household_power_consumption.txt) is.

* On R, set the working directory to where are the files use the comand `wd("path")`.

* Run the script on R console using the `source( 'plotX.R' )` substitute the X for 1, 2, 3 or 4 to make the respective plot.

* Alternatively you can run the command `R CMD BATCH plotX.R` on your operational system terminal. Again, substitute the X for 1 to 4, depending on the plot to make.

## Output

The output of the scripts are a .png file, with the dimensions 480 X 480px, containing the plots. Those files will be on a plots directory `./plots` on the working directory.
